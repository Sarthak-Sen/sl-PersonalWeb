        <p>
          So first of all, welcome to my page. This is something I built for an
          assignment. <br />
          Pretty Neat, isnt't it? <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          I love reading. Kinda sorta a nerd. Also love anime and writing. Like
          playing keyboard and telling stories. <br />And...am a so so chess
          player
        </p>
        <p>  Well, I need to fill up some space. So here are my thoughts on certain books/anime/music pieces:- <br><br>
          1. My favourite piece of fiction so far has been 1984. I still remember skipping my lunch to read it in the school library. 
          This book made me fall in love with dystopia. Most of all, it cleared up all my doubts. I hated happy endings! Dystopia is still my way to go.<br><br>
          2. My favourite chess opening for white is the London System. Helps to develop pieces and give me a balanced mid-game. For black, 
          I choose the Sicilian Defense. It is the strongest counter to e4. I try to switch to Hyperaccelerated Dragon whenever I can.<br><br>
          3. My current anime of choice is Attack on Titan. One of the main themes explored in this anime is the issue of morality.
          How far should on be willing to go to reach his goals? <br><br>
          4. Well, favourite food as of right now is Papri Chat. Had it since childhood <br><br>
          5. I write short stories. Try to add some Lovecraftian Themes to it. Romances and happy ending aren't really my thing! <br><br>
          6. Interstellar by Hans Zimmer is my piano score of choice. It helps to put an anxious mind to rest after a tiring day of homework and assignments.
